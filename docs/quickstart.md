# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

### macOS

- Homebrew installed and available in PATH.
- `git` available.

### Ubuntu/Debian (and derivatives like Linux Mint, Pop!_OS)

- `apt-get` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.

### Arch Linux (and derivatives like Manjaro, EndeavourOS)

- `pacman` available (standard on these distros).
- `sudo` access for package installs.
- `git` available.

### All platforms

- Go 1.24+ (for building from source).
- Node.js / npm if installing Claude Code (agent is installed via `npm install -g`).

## Run

```bash
go run ./cmd/gentle-ai install --dry-run
```

Use `--dry-run` first to validate selections and execution plan without applying changes. The dry-run output includes a `Platform decision` line showing the detected OS, distro, package manager, and support status.

## First real install

```bash
go run ./cmd/gentle-ai install
```

The installer detects your platform automatically — no flags needed to select macOS vs Linux. Install commands are resolved through the appropriate package manager (brew, apt, or pacman) based on detection.

After completion, verify that agent configs and selected components were installed to their expected paths.

## Verification outcome

When checks pass, installer reports:

`You're ready. Run 'claude' or 'opencode' and start building.`

## Unsupported platforms

If you run the installer on an unsupported OS or Linux distro (e.g., Fedora, Windows), it exits immediately with an error:

- `unsupported operating system: only macOS and Linux are supported in v0.2.0 (detected <os>)`
- `unsupported linux distro: Linux support is limited to Ubuntu/Debian and Arch (detected <distro>)`
